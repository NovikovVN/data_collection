Most of the web applications contain both private(sensitive) and public information in theircorresponding database that brings the security of private information on the forefront of the challenge of this domain. Cyber criminals can attempt to stealor tamperwith private information from these insecure or vulnerable web applications by exploiting. In this paper, we have analyzed different approaches of web application security used in current practices since their development such as secure coding, Web...\\nUnderstanding Predication in Conceptual Spaces\\nWe argue that a cognitive semantics has to take into account the possibly partial information that a cognitive agent has of the world. After discussing Gärdenfors's view of objects in conceptual spaces, we offer a number of viable treatments of partiality of information and we formalize them by means of alternative predicative logics. Our analysis shows that understanding the nature of simple predicative sentences is crucial for a cognitive semantics.\\nCONFERENCE CYBERPOLITICS CALL COIMBRA 2019\\nThe task of tracing the new frontiers of the political implies a critical effort that faces a double difficulty: first of all, the confrontation between contemporary political theory and the virtual speed of the present that results in a complex delimitation and circumscription of a new hermeneutic horizon of the public space; and a second obstacle that consists of the construction of the concept of Cyberpolitics itself that, by its paradigmatic nature, involves a transformation and metamorphosis which we will also try to map. This effort will require a genealogical investigation into the...\\nArabic Voice Recognition Using Fuzzy Logic and Neural Network\\nThis research adapted and implemented an algorithm for commanding using speech recognition in ARABIC language in addition to English, and the ability to train the system using other languages. The recognition based on discrete coefficient of the wavelet transform. Intelligent recognizer is built for two models, the first is Neural Networks, and the second is Fuzzy Logic Recognizer. The proposed speech recognition system consists of three phases; preprocessing phase (two processes are performed on the sound, DC level removal and resizing of sample for 2000 samples for each sound), feature...\\nInfluence of process variables on the properties of pulp obtained by ethanol pulping of wheat straw\\nImpact of Water Hardness in Instinctive Laundry System Based on Fuzzy Logic Controller\\nIn this paper, we discuss the effects of water types and temperature in automatic washing machine. The automatic washing machines are being used in hard water areas void of useful results because machines could not detect the type of water. Hard water consumes more detergent and washing time for laundry. The proposition of the paper is that the soft water and high temperature should be used in washing machines, it will not only reduce the quantity of detergent but also have positive effects on economy and fabrics. In this way, energy and washing time can be saved. The results are verified...\\nAcademia, 580 California St., Suite 400, San Francisco, CA, 94104\\nUnsubscribe   Privacy Policy   Terms of Service   © 2019 Academia\\n\""
